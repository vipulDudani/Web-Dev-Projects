The calculator you built is a web-based application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The interface is designed using HTML and CSS, giving it a visually appealing and user-friendly look.

At the top of the calculator, you may have added a display screen where the input and output of the calculations are shown. This display screen is implemented using HTML elements like div or input, and styled using CSS to make it visually appealing and easy to read.

Below the display screen, you may have created a grid of buttons for the numbers (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /). These buttons are implemented using HTML button elements, and CSS is used to style them to make them visually appealing and responsive.

To make the calculator functional, you would have implemented the logic using JavaScript. You may have used event listeners to detect when buttons are clicked, and then performed the appropriate calculations based on the user's input. For example, when a number button is clicked, the corresponding number is displayed on the calculator's display screen. When an operator button is clicked, the calculator may have stored the current input and operator for later use in the calculation. When the equal (=) button is clicked, the calculator would have performed the arithmetic operation using the stored input and operator, and displayed the result on the display screen.
