Our web development project offers a comprehensive toolkit that includes a calculator, BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator, to-do app, and quote generator, all in one place. This web application is designed to provide users with a range of useful tools for everyday tasks, making it a convenient and practical resource.

The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a user-friendly interface with input fields for numbers and buttons for operators, making it easy for users to perform calculations quickly and accurately.

The BMI calculator helps users to calculate their body mass index, which is a commonly used measure to assess if an individual's weight is healthy for their height. Users can input their height and weight, and the BMI calculator will automatically calculate and display their BMI along with an appropriate BMI category (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese).

The to-do app provides a simple and effective way for users to create and manage their tasks and to-do lists. Users can add tasks, set due dates, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks as needed. The to-do app helps users stay organized and focused on their tasks, making it a valuable tool for managing their daily activities.

The quote generator displays random inspirational quotes to users, providing motivation and inspiration. Users can click on a "Generate" button to generate a new quote, and they can also share quotes on social media platforms. The quote generator adds a positive and uplifting element to the web application, enhancing the overall user experience.
